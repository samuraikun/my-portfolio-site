# Mid Term - Personal Portfolio Website

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to create a personal portfolio website that will be used to showcase your work and skills to potential employers. This website will be a living document that you can update throughout the program and beyond.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```zsh
     git clone <repository url>
   ```

2. Go to the repository directory in your local machine.

   ```zsh
     cd ./path-to-repository
   ```

3. Install dependencies.

   ```zsh
     npm install
   ```

4. Build css files and run live-server

   ```zsh
     npm run dev
   ```

## Requirements

- Before you start building it, create a wireframe of your website. You can use Whimsical to create it and add a screenshot to your repository.

- Your website must have the following sections/pages:

  - Home
  - About
  - Projects
  - Skills (Soft and Hard Skills)
  - Work Experiences
  - Contact

- You can choose to have a separate page for each section or you can have a single page with multiple sections.

## Workflow

- Create a new branch with a descriptive name of your first implementation.
- Commit often and write descriptive commit messages.
- Once you are done with your first implementation, push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request.
- Once your pull request is approved, merge your branch into the main branch.
- Create a new branch for your second implementation and repeat the process.

## Content

- Add a short bio about yourself.
- Add some images to your website. It can be a picture of yourself or any other image that you like. Screenshots of your projects are also a good idea.
- I know you don't have projects yet but I can add this project as the first.
