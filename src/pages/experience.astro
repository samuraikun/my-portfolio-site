  <div class="mb-10 text-start">
    With a foundational understanding in both front and back-end development, along with some experience in optimizing build environments and constructing infrastructures using AWS and Terraform, I have had the opportunity to engage in a variety of technological challenges.<br><br>
    My experiences range from enhancing video transcoding infrastructure, to freelance projects aimed at improving educational platforms, a part-time role establishing a new AWS infrastructure for a pharmaceutical project, and a previous engagement developing and operating a business card databasing service. Currently, I continue to broaden my skills and contribute to meaningful projects as a freelance developer, each experience contributing to my ongoing learning and adaptability across different project scenarios.
